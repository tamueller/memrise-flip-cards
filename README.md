# memrise-flip-cards
This userscript allows you to learn with the classical card mechanism. You see the question, flip the card, and then choose whether you knew it correctly or not. It is very easy to cheat with this method. And very stupid.



### Usage

Once installed, if you are on a test screen you will have thre buttons. "Flip", "Right" and "Wrong". You can press "Right" and "Wrong" even before flipping the card. The hotkeys are Cursor Up, Cursor Right and Cursor Left.

### Installation

The easiest method is through an extension/add-on on chrome/firefox:

- Chrome: install the [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) extension

- Firefox: If you do not have chrome, you might try Greasemonkey, I havent tested it with fireforx though. I'd be happy about feedback. Install the [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) add-on

Then add the script using the following link: https://github.com/tamueller/memrise-flip-cards/raw/master/memrise-flip-cards.user.js
